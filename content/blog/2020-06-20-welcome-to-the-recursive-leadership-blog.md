I'm a big fan of the [Unfolding Leadership Blog](http://www.unfoldingleadership.com/blog/) by Dan Oestreich.  If you haven't read his blog, you should subscribe and check it out (and subscribe to this one while you are at it).

That blog helped inspire the name of this blog.  I've spent most of my professional career developing software. [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is a technique to solve a problem or generate some output by having a function call itself.  It creates somewhat of a nesting-doll effect as information is pushed onto stack memory and the logic folds in on itself.  At a certain point, the recursive algorithm will reach the "center" of the logic and will begin to unfold back towards the answer.

In my own life and on my journies with others, I've observed this same pattern in emotional, intelectual, social, and psychological growth: we often need to recurse a few levels deeper into ourselves and connect with something there before we can unfold back into growth and reconnect with the here and now.

Thank you for joining me on this journey exploring how we can recurse through life.  I'm looking forward to learning many new lessons together.
