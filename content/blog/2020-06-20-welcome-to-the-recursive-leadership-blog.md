I'm a big fan of the [Unfolding Leadership Blog](http://www.unfoldingleadership.com/blog/) by Dan Oestreich.  His insightful posts have been pivotal in my personal journey toward more empathy and more understanding of how "we" can get twisted up in problems and how to "untwist" when that happens. If you haven't read his blog, you should check it out and subscribe (and subscribe to mine while you are at it).

The title of the "Unfolding Leadership" blog, along with my respect and admiration of Dan's work, inspired me to title my blog "Recursion".  I have spent most of my professional career developing software. [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)) is a technique used to solve a problem by having a function call itself.  Recursion creates a nesting-doll effect as information is pushed onto stack memory and the logic folds in on itself.  At a certain point, the recursive algorithm will reach the "center" of the logic and will begin to unfold back out towards the answer.

In my own life and on my journeys with others, I have observed a recursive pattern in emotional, intellectual, social, and psychological growth: we often need to recurse a few levels deeper into ourselves and connect with something at our core before we can unfold back into new growth and reconnect with the present external reailities.

Thank you for joining me on this journey exploring how we can recurse through life.  I'm looking forward to learning many new lessons together.
